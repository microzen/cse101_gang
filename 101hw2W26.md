## Question 3

You are given a simple directed graph $G$ with vertex set $V$ , edge set E and vertex labels $w(v) \in \{0,1\}$ as well as a starting and ending vertex $s$, $t$. Design a reasonably efficient algorithm that determines if there is a walk from s to t that goes through exactly two “0” vertices.

**Solution**:

**High level algorithm description**:

Create a graph $G'$, for each vertex $v$ of $G$, create 2 copies of each vertex in $G'$ named $v^{(1)}$ and $v^{(2)}$. 

For each edge $e=(u,v)$ in $G$.
- If $w(e)=0$, create edges $(u^{(1)},v^{(1)})$ and $(u^{(2)},v^{(2)})$ in $G'$.
- If $w(e)=1$, create edges $(u^{(1)},v^{(2)})$ in $G'$.

Run $explore(G',s^{(1)})$ and if $t^{(2)}$ is visited then reture True, otherwise return False.

**Justification of correctness**:

Suppose that graph $G$ has a path for $s$ to $t$ that goes through exactly one edge with weight 1. 

Prove the algorithm works correctly.

Then, there is a path $(s,v_1,\dots,v_n,t)$ in $G$ such that there exists exactly one edge with weight 1 in this path, and there exists edges $(v^{(1)}_i, u^{(2)}_{i+1})$ that connects $v^{(1)}$ and $v^{(2)}$ in $G'$. 

For each vertex $(v_j,v_{j+1})$ in the path before edge $e_i$ that weight 1, there exist the vertices $(v^{(1)}_j, u^{(1)}_{j+1})$ in graph $G'$. 

For each vertex $(v_k,v_{k+1})$ in the path after edge $e_i$ that weight 1, there exist the vertices $(v^{(2)}_k, u^{(2)}_{k+1})$ in graph $G'$.

Therefore, there is a path from $s^{(1)}$ to $t^{(2)}$, namely: 

$$(s^{(1)},\dots,v^{(1)}_i,v^{(2)}_{i+1},\dots,t^{(2)})$$

Therefore, when the $explore(G',s^{(1)})$ algorithm runs, $t^{(2)}$ will be visited.

Suppose the algorithm return True, then there mush be a path in $G'$ from $s^{(1)}$ to $t^{(2)}$. 

Since there is not any path from $v^{(2)}$ to $v^{(1)}$, there must be one edge with weight 1 goes $(v^{(1)}_i,v^{(2)}_{i+1})$.

Also, there exist the vertices $V_1' = (s^{(0)},v^{(0)}_i)$ which $w(V_1') = 0$, and the vertices $V_2' = (v^{(1)}_{i+1},t^{(1)})$ which $w(V_2') = 0$, and the vertices $V_3' = (v^{(0)}_i,v^{(1)}_{i+1})$ which $w(V_3') = 1$. Therefore, there exist exactly one edge that weight 1 on this path from $s^{(1)}$ to $t^{(2)}$ in $G'$.


**Runtime Analysis**:

If graph $G$ has $|V|$ vertices and $|E|$ edges, then $G'$ has $2|V|$ vertices and $2|E|$ edges. Thus, creating $G'$ takes $O(2|V| + 2|E|)$ time, which is considered as $O(|V|+|E|)$ time. Also, explore algorithm on $G'$ takes $O(|V|+|E|)$ time.

Therefore, the whole algorithm takes $O(|V|+|E|)$ time.

## Question 4

Suppose there is a galaxy with n planets each with its own military. There are m treaties each involving two different planets (planet A and planet B) of the form: if planet A is at war, then planet B is obligated to join the war as an ally to A.

A planet alliance bloc is a group of planets such that if any one of them is at war, all the rest of the alliance bloc will join the war as an ally (either directly or through an intermediary.)

Design an algorithm that, given a list of n planets and a list of m treaties, labels each planet with a number such that two planets in the same alliance bloc are labeled with the same number.

(8 points for reasonably efficient correct high level algorithm description (with correctness proof), 4 points for correct time analysis, and 3 points for efficiency of your algorithm.)

**Answer**:

- Algorithm Description:

  Build a directed graph G = (V,E) where each planet is a vertex, and if planet A is obligated to go to war because of planet B, then there is a directed edge from B to A.

  Run SCC on G and assign each planet a label equal to the SCC number it belongs to.

  - Runtime:

  Running SCC takes O(|V|+|E|) time, and assigning labels to all vertices takes O|V|) time. Since O(|V| + |E|) is bigger, runtime is O(|V| + |E|).

- Justification of correctness:

(Showing that planets in the same alliance bloc recieve the same label)

Consider 2 planets u and v, which are both in the same SCC. By deffinition of SCC, there is a directed path from u to v and vice versa. If one of them goes to war, then the obligations go along these paths, forcing the other planet to join. Therefore, all planets in SCC form an alliance bloc and are correctly given the same label.

(Showing that planets in different SCCs cannot be in the same alliance bloc)

Consider 2 planets u and v, which are in different SCC. This means at least 1 of them cannot be reached frrom the other. Therefore, there exist a situation that if a planet goes to war, the other is not obligated to join. Therefore, planets in different SCCs cannot be in the same alliance bloc. They recieve different labels.
