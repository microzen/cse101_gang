## Question 3

You are given a simple directed graph $G$ with vertex set $V$ , edge set E and vertex labels $w(v) \in \{0,1\}$ as well as a starting and ending vertex $s$, $t$. Design a reasonably efficient algorithm that determines if there is a walk from s to t that goes through exactly two “0” vertices.

**Solution**:

**High level algorithm description**:

Greate a graph $G'$, for each vertex $v$ of $G$, create 2 copies of each vertex in $G'$ named $v^{(1)}$ and $v^{(2)}$. 

For each edge $e=(u,v)$ in $G$.
- If $w(e)=0$, create edges $(u^{(1)},v^{(1)})$ and $(u^{(2)},v^{(2)})$ in $G'$.
- If $w(e)=1$, create edges $(u^{(1)},v^{(2)})$ in $G'$.

Run $explore(G',s^{(1)})$ and if $t^{(2)}$ is visited then reture True, otherwise return False.

**Justification of correctness**:

Suppose that graph $G$ has a path for $s$ to $t$ that goes through exactly one edge that has weight 1. 

Prove the algorithm works correctly.

Then, there is a path $(s,v_1,\dots,v_n,t)$ in $G$ such that there exists exactly one edge has weight 1 in this path, and there exists edges $(v^{(1)}_i, u^{(2)}_{i+1})$ that connects $v^{(1)}$ and $v^{(2)}$ in $G'$. 

For each vertex $(v_j,v_{j+1})$ in the path before edge $e_i$ that weight 1, there exist the vertices $(v^{(1)}_j, u^{(1)}_{j+1})$ in graph $G'$. 

For each vertex $(v_k,v_{k+1})$ in the path after edge $e_i$ that weight 1, there exist the vertices $(v^{(2)}_k, u^{(2)}_{k+1})$ in graph $G'$.

Therefore, there is a path from $s^{(1)}$ to $t^{(2)}$, namely: 

$$(s^{(1)},\dots,v^{(1)}_i,v^{(2)}_{i+1},\dots,t^{(2)})$$

Therefore, when the $explore(G',s^{(1)})$ algorithm runs, $t^{(2)}$ will be visited.

Suppose the algorithm return Ture, then there mush be a path in $G'$ from $s^{(1)}$ to $t^{(2)}$. 

Since there is not any path from $v^{(2)}$ to $v^{(1)}$, there mush be one edge that weight 1 goes $(v^{(1)}_i,v^{(2)}_{i+1})$.

Also, there exist the vecticse $V_1' = (s^{(0)},v^{(0)}_i)$ which $w(V_1') = 0$, and the vecticse $V_2' = (v^{(1)}_{i+1},t^{(1)})$ which $w(V_2') = 0$, and the vecticse $V_3' = (v^{(0)}_i,v^{(1)}_{i+1})$ which $w(V_3') = 1$. Therefore, there exist exaclty one edge that weight 1 on this path from $s^{(1)}$ to $t^{(2)}$ in $G'$.


**Runtime Analysis**:

If graph $G$ has $|V|$ verticse and $|E|$ edges, then $G'$ has $2|V|$ verticse and $2|E|$ edges. Thus, creating $G'$ taks $O(2|V| + 2|E|)$ time, which is considered as $O(|V|+|E|)$ time. Also, explore algorithem on $G'$ takes $O(|V|+|E|)$ time.

Therefore, the whole algorithem takes $O(|V|+|E|)$ time.
