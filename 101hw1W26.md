## Question 1

[The purpose of this problem is to review a few concepts we will need in this class: asymptotic notation, recurrence relations and induction]

Recall that the definition of Big-Oh is:

f(n) = O(g(n)) means that there exists a real number C > 0 and an integer k > 0 such that

$$f(n) \leq C ∗ g(n) \text{ for all n } \geq k$$

a) Prove the following statement:
$2^n*(n!)^2 = O((2n)!).$

[Hint: prove by induction.]

**Answer**:

Base case: $n >= 0$ so let n = 0

$2^0*(0!)^2 = 1 = O((2*0)!)\text{  }$  **True**

Induction Hypothesis:

$$\text{Assume: } 2^m * (m!)^2 = O((2m)!) \text{ for some integer } C_1 > 0 \text{ and for all } m \geq k_1 > 0$$

$$2^m\cdot(m!)^2 \leq C_1\cdot(2m)!$$

Induction Step:

Start from $2^{m+1} * ((m+1)!)^2 = O((2(m+1))!)$

which means, $2^{m+1} * ((m+1)!)^2 \leq C_2\cdot(2(m+1))!$ for some $C_2 > 0$ and for all $(m+1) \geq k_2 > 0$

<=> $2(m+1)^2\cdot2^m * (m!)^2 \leq \displaystyle\frac{C_2}{C_1}\cdot(2m+2)!\cdot C1$

Using our hypothesis, we now only need to prove that $2(m+1)^2 \leq \displaystyle\frac{C2}{C1}*(2m + 2)(2m +1)$
<=> $m^2 + 2m + 1 \leq \displaystyle\frac{C2}{C1}\cdot(2m^2 + 3m + 1)$

Proved.

b) Define the sequence D(n) recursively in the following way: D(0) = 1, D(1) = 2 and

$$D(n) = (1/2)D(n − 1) + 2D(n − 2) \text{ for }n ≥ 2$$

Prove that $D(n) = O(2^n)$

**Answer**:
This is a HRRCC equation.

Let $D(n) = Ar^n$.

$$Ar^n = \displaystyle\frac{1}{2}\cdot Ar^{n-1} + 2Ar^{n-2}$$

$$r^2 = \displaystyle\frac{1}{2}\cdot r + 2$$

$$ r = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{33}}{4}$$

According to HRRCC formula, $D(n) = \theta (1.6861^n)$

And since $\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty}\displaystyle\frac{1.6861^n}{2^n} = 0$, 

$D(n) = O(2^n)$.

Proved.
## Question 2

Let $B(n)$ be the $n$-th Complete Balanced Bipartite Graph on $2n$ vertices. $B(n)$ has $2n$ vertices $n$ on each side. One side has vertices labeled $a_1,\dots,a_n$ and the other side has vertices labeled $b_1,\dots,b_n$. There is an edge connecting $a_i$ and $b_j$ for all $1\leq i,j\leq n$.

Below is the graph of $B(3):$

![[Bipartite.png]]

(a) How many edges does $B(n)$ have? (no justification necessary)

$$n^2$$

(b) Let $H(n)$ be the number of Hamiltonian paths of $B(n)$ that start from an $a_i$ vertex and ends at a $b_j$ vertex (Hamiltonian paths are paths that go through each vertex exactly once.)
Give an explanation as to why $H(n) = (n!)^2$

Since B(n) is a bipartite graph, any Hamiltonian path must alternate between vertices in set A and set B. Given the path starts at an $a_i$ and ends at a $b_j$, the visitation order is fixed as $A \to B \to A \to \dots \to B$.

Permutations:
- There are n! ways to order the n vertices of set A.
- There are n! ways to order the n vertices of set B.

Since the graph is a 'complete' bipartite graph, edges exist between all pairs (a, b). Thus, any permutation of A combined with any permutation of B forms a valid path.

$$H(n) = n! \times n! = (n!)^2$$

(c) Let $P(N)$ be the number of Hamiltonian paths of a Complete Bipartite Graph on $N$ vertices. Determine the big-Theta bound of $P(N)$.

The total number of vertices is N. Since $B(n)$ has $n$ vertices on each side, $N = 2n$, which implies $n = \frac{N}{2}$.

A Hamiltonian path can start in set A or set B. There are $(n!)^2$ paths for each.
Thus, 

$$P(N) = (n!)^2 + (n!)^2 = 2(n!)^2$$

Substitute $n = N/2$ into the equation:

$$P(N)=2*\left( \left( \frac{N}{2} \right)! \right)^2$$

Dropping the constant factor 2, we get:

$$\Theta\left( \left( \left( \frac{N}{2} \right)! \right)^2 \right)$$

## Question 3

An adjacency matrix for an undirected graph with vertices labeled $1$ through $n$ is a symmetric matrix such that entry $(i,j)$ is 1 if there is an edge between vertex $i$ and vertex $j$ and 0 otherwise.

Example: Here is a graph and its adjacency matrix.

A triangle in an undirected, simple graph is a set of three distinct vertices $x, y, z$ such that all pairs are connected by an edge.

You are given $A$, the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph $G$.

Design an algorithm that determines (outputs True or False) whether $G$ has a triangle or not.

(You can present your algorithm using pseudocode. Please also include a runtime analysis. You do not need to write a proof of correctness for this problem (but it would be helpful to think of one.))

Solution:

1. Algorithm(Pseudocode)
```
Algorithm HasTriangle(A):
    n = A.rows
    for i = 1 to n:
        for j = i + 1 to n:
            if A[i][j] == 1:  // Check edge (i, j)
                for k = j + 1 to n:
                    // Check edges (j, k) and (i, k)
                    if A[j][k] == 1 and A[i][k] == 1:
                        return True
    return False
```

2. Runtime Analysis
The runtime is $O(n^3)$. This is because there are three nested loops iterating through the vertices to check combinations of $(i, j, k)$, which results in roughly $\binom{n}{3}$ iterations, and the operations inside the loops take constant time.

## Question 4

[The main motivation for this problem is to see what a reduction algorithm looks like. Also, in this problem, you will practice writing a bi-directional proof for an algorithm that solves a decision problem.] Given a directed graph G with vertex weights wv ∈ {0, 1, 2} (in other words, each vertex is either labeled with a,b or c), and vertices s and t, Determine if there is a path in G from s to t such that the sequence of vertex labels in the path goes in weakly increasing order.

Algorithm Description: Consider the following algorithm that claims to solve this problem: alphabetical

Input: a {0, 1, 2}-labeled directed graph G, a vertex s of G and a vertex t of G. 

Create a graph G′ by removing all edges (u, v) such that w(u) > w(v). 

Run graphsearch on G′ starting from s. If t is visited then return TRUE. Otherwise return FALSE

(NOTE: graphsearch is an algorithm that takes a graph G and a vertex s and returns a list of vertices
that are reachable from s by a directed path in G. You do not have to prove the correctness of
graphsearch, we will do this in class.)

Prove that this algorithm is correct.

(Hint: your proof must show that the algorithm correctly returns TRUE when the input has the desired
property and correctly returns FALSE when the input does not have the desired property. This means
you must do a bi-directional proof.)

**Answer**: We need to prove that if the algorithm returns true, there is a weakly increasing path from s to t and vice versa.

First, we assume that the algorithm returns true.

According to graphsearch, this means there is a direct path from s to t in G'.

By definition of G', an edge between u and v only exists if $w(u) \leq w(v)$

Hence, every consecutive pair of vertices along the path from s to t in G' satisfies: $w(v_i) \leq w(v_{i+1})$. This is the definition of weakly increasing.

Since G' is the subgraph of G, this path also exists in G.

Conclusion: There is a weakly increasing path from s to t in G if the algorithm returns true.

Now, we assume there is a weakly increasing path from s to t in G.

This means, for every consecutive pair of vertices along the path from s to t in G, $w(v_i) \leq w(v_{i+1})$.

Therefore, if we create G', no edge on the path is removed, and the entire path exists in G'. Finally, graphsearch from s to t will return true.

Conclusion: The algorithm returns true if there is a weakly increasing path from s to t in G.
