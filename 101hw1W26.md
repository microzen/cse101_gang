## Question 2

Let $B(n)$ be the $n$th \emph{Complete Balanced Bipartite Graph} on $2n$ vertices. $B(n)$ has $2n$ vertices $n$ on each side. One side has vertices labeled $a_1,\dots,a_n$ and the other side has vertices labeled $b_1,\dots,b_n$. There is an edge connecting $a_i$ and $b_j$ for all $1\leq i,j\leq n$
Below is the graph of $B(3):$

(a) How many edges does $B(n)$ have? (no justification necessary)
$$n^2$$
(b) Let $H(n)$ be the number of Hamiltonian paths of $B(n)$ that start from an $a_i$ vertex and ends at a $b_j$ vertex (Hamiltonian paths are paths that go through each vertex exactly once.)
Give an explanation as to why $H(n) = (n!)^2$

Since B(n) is a bipartite graph, any Hamiltonian path must alternate between vertices in set A and set B. Given the path starts at an $a_i$ and ends at a $b_j$, the visitation order is fixed as $A \to B \to A \to \dots \to B$.

Permutations:
- There are n! ways to order the n vertices of set A.
- There are n! ways to order the n vertices of set B.

Since the graph is a 'complete' bipartite graph, edges exist between all pairs (a, b). Thus, any permutation of A combined with any permutation of B forms a valid path.
$$H(n) = n! \times n! = (n!)^2$$

(c) Let $P(N)$ be the number of Hamiltonian paths of a Complete Bipartite Graph on $N$ vertices. Determine the big-Theta bound of $P(N)$.
