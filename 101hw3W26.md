## Question 2
Suppose you are visiting an island nation made up of $n$ islands. There are (one-way) daily ferry services each given by $(I_d,I_a,t_d,t_a)$ where $I_d$ is the departure island, $I_a$ is the arrival island, $t_d$ is the departure time and $t_a$ is the arrival time. You can assume that each time is different and that the earliest departure time is 8 in the morning and the latest arrival time is 8 at night. You may need to spend the night on an island in order to make a connection.

(a) You start on island $s$ and wish to get to island $t$. Determine the minimum number of overnights you must spend on islands to make this journey. (8 points for reasonably efficient correct high level algorithm description (with correctness proof), 4
points for correct time analysis, and 3 points for efficiency of your algorithm.)

Algorithm Description: 

Construct a directed graph $G' = (V', E')$ where each ferry service $(I_d, I_a, t_d, t_a)$ is represented by two vertices: a departure node $(I_d, t_d)$ and an arrival node $(I_a, t_a)$. Add a directed edge with weight 0 for each ferry service from its departure node to its arrival node. For each island, sort all associated vertices by time. Add a weight-0 edge between consecutive vertices $(t_1, t_2)$ if $t_1 \le t_2$ (same-day connection), and a weight-1 edge if $t_1 > t_2$ (overnight stay). Create a source $s_{start}$ connected to all events on island $s$ and a sink $t_{end}$ connected from all events on island $t$ with weight-0 edges. Run Dijkstra's from $s_{start}$ to $t_{end}$.

Proof of Correctness: 

Each path in $G'$ corresponds to a valid sequence of ferry trips. Weight-1 edges correctly account for each overnight stay required when a connection time precedes the previous arrival. Since the algorithm finds the shortest path in this weighted graph, the resulting distance to $t_{end}$ is the minimum number of overnights.

Runtime Analysis: 

With $m$ ferry services and $n$ islands, $G'$ contains $O(m)$ vertices and $O(m)$ edges. Sorting events per island takes $O(m \log m)$. Running Dijkstra's takes $O(m \log m)$. The total runtime is $O(m \log m)$.

(b) You start on island $s$ and you wish to get to island $t$ but you want to arrive on island $t$ at the earliest possible time of day (regardless of how many overnights you spend. This is a different question.) Your algorithm should return the earliest time of day you can arrive on island $t$. (8 points for reasonably efficient correct high level algorithm description (with correctness proof), 4
points for correct time analysis, and 3 points for efficiency of your algorithm.)

Algorithm Description:

Use the graph $G'$ constructed in part (a), which contains vertices for each ferry event and edges for ferry trips, same-day connections, and overnight stays. Treat all edges in $G'$ as having weight 0 (or simply as directed unweighted edges) and run a reachability algorithm such as BFS or Explore starting from the super-source $s_{start}$. After identifying all reachable vertices, examine all arrival nodes associated with island $t$, denoted as $(t, t_a)$. The algorithm returns the minimum $t_a$ among all such reachable nodes.

Proof of Correctness:

The graph $G'$ correctly models all possible sequences of ferry journeys, with overnight edges ensuring that any arrival can eventually lead to any subsequent departure from the same island on a later day. By running a reachability traversal, the algorithm identifies every possible time of day $t_a$ at which island $t$ can be reached. Selecting the minimum $t_a$ ensures the earliest arrival time of day, regardless of the total number of overnights spent, satisfying the problem's requirement.

Runtime Analysis:

The graph $G'$ has $O(m)$ vertices and $O(m)$ edges, and its construction takes $O(m \log m)$ due to sorting. Running BFS or Explore on this graph takes $O(V' + E') = O(m)$. Finding the minimum $t_a$ among reachable nodes at island $t$ takes $O(m)$. The total runtime is $O(m \log m)$, which is consistent with the efficiency of part (a).
